Hi, I am Artem.

I am a radio engineer in the past. For now, I am interested
in Mobile Application Development, because I am loving
to write a code and do various task.

I hope, I can achieve new heights in Mobile Development,
especially in Android development, because I am reliable,
organized person, and plodding, and my previous background
will help me too.

Oh, and my favourite animal is a budgie, because such animals are freefull.
This is a good feature for me. And cats are good too.

Thank you, 
Artem.
